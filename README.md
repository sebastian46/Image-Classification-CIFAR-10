# CIFAR-10 Image Classification using CNN

This project involves creating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.

## CNN Architecture Explanation

The architecture of the CNN used in this project is designed to effectively learn features from the CIFAR-10 dataset. Here's a breakdown of the architecture:

### Convolutional Layers

- **First Convolutional Layer**: The first layer uses 32 filters of size 3x3 and a 'ReLU' activation function. This layer is responsible for capturing low-level features such as edges and corners.
  
- **Second and Third Convolutional Layers**: These layers further refine the features captured by the preceding layers. They have 64 filters each, which allows the network to learn more complex patterns.

### Max Pooling Layers

- **Pooling Layers**: After each set of convolutional layers, a max pooling layer with a 2x2 filter is used. These layers reduce the spatial dimensions (height and width) of the input volume for the next convolutional layer. They help in reducing the computational load, memory usage, and also help in making the model more robust to variations in the position of features in the input image.

### Flatten Layer

- **Flatten**: This layer flattens the 3D output of the last convolutional layer into a 1D array. It transforms the learned features into a format suitable for the dense layer.

### Dense Layers

- **First Dense Layer**: A dense layer with 64 neurons is used, which serves as a fully connected layer. It takes the flattened input and performs classification on the features learned by the convolutional layers.

- **Output Layer**: The final layer has 10 neurons (equal to the number of classes in CIFAR-10). It outputs a probability distribution over the 10 classes.

## Why This Architecture?

1. **Efficiency**: This architecture is relatively simple but efficient for the CIFAR-10 dataset. It strikes a balance between learning capability and computational efficiency.

2. **Reduced Overfitting**: The use of multiple layers with fewer filters helps in reducing overfitting, which is a common issue in deep learning models.

3. **Feature Learning**: The sequential arrangement of convolutional and max pooling layers allows the model to effectively learn and refine features from the images, crucial for accurate classification.

4. **Scalability**: This architecture can be easily scaled. More layers can be added, or the number of neurons in the dense layers can be increased to improve the model's performance if required.

## Conclusion

This CNN architecture provides a solid foundation for image classification tasks using the CIFAR-10 dataset. It can be further optimized and experimented with for improved accuracy and performance.
